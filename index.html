   <h1 class="ltwul">ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ I love the way you lie ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥</h1>

   <p><b>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
I love the way you lie</b></p>

<div class="eminem">

<p class="ltwul">I can't tell you what it really is<br>
I can only tell you what it feels like<br>
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe<br>
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight<br>
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight</p>

<p>High off her love, drunk from her hate<br>
It's like I'm huffing paint<br>
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate<br>
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me<br>
She fucking hates me, and I love it, wait!</p>

<p>Where you going? I'm leaving you<br>
No you ain't, come back<br>
We're running right back, here we go again<br>
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great<br>
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane</p>

<p>But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed<br>
I snapped: Who's that dude? I don't even know his name<br>
I laid hands on him, I'll never stoop so low again<br>
I guess I don't know my own strength</p></div>

<p class="ltwul">Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it <b>hurts</b><br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
<b>I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie</b></p>
<div class="eminem">
<p>You ever loved somebody so much<br>
You can barely breathe when you're with 'em?<br>
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em<br>
Got that warm fuzzy feelin'<br>
Yeah, them chills used to get 'em<br>
Now you're gettin' fucking sick of looking at 'em?</p>

<p>You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em<br>
Now you're in each other's face<br>
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em<br>
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them<br>
Throw 'em down, pin 'em<br>
So lost in the moments when you're in them</p>

<p>It's the rage that took over, it controls you both<br>
So they say it's best to go your separate ways<br>
Guess that they don't know ya<br>
'Cause today, that was yesterday<br>
Yesterday is over, it's a different day<br>
Sound like broken records playing over</p>

<p>But you promised her<br>
Next time you'd show restraint<br>
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game<br>
But you lied again<br>
Now you get to watch her leave out the window<br>
Guess that's why they call it window pane</p></div>

<p class="ltwul">Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?<br>
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me <b>cry?</b><br>
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie<br>
<b>I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie</b></p>

<p class="eminem">Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean<br>
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine<br>
But your temper's just as bad as mine is<br>
You're the same as me<br>
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded</p>

<p class="eminem">Baby, please, come back<br>
It wasn't you, baby, it was me<br>
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems<br>
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano<br>
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though</p>

<p class="eminem">Come inside<br>
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk<br>
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?<br>
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball<br>
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall</p>

<p class="eminem">Next time? There will be no next time!<br>
I apologize even though I know it's lies<br>
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back</p>

<p class="eminem">I know I'm a liar<br>
If she ever tries to fucking leave again<br>
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire<br>
Just gonna</p>

<p class="ltwul">Just gonna stand there and watch me <b>burn?</b><br>
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts<br>
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?<br>
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie<br>
<b>I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie</b></p>
